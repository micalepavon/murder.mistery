# SQL Murder Mystery
There's been a Murder in SQL City! The SQL Murder Mystery is designed to be both a self-directed lesson to learn SQL concepts and commands and a fun game for experienced SQL users to solve an intriguing crime.

It was a fun experience to complete this game. It was a definite rush while completing all the steps and finally getting the answer!

I hope you get what you deserve, Miranda Priestly and Jeremy Bowers lol :P
